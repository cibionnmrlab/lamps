					The AMW Summer School is a two day event preceding the Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management 2018 to be held in Cali, Colombia. 
					The event consists of multiple tutorials aimed at a mixed audience of students and other interested attendees. </p>
					<h3>Our goals</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>Host tutorials targeted at students (advanced undergraduate or postgraduate level) or other early term researchers interested in the area of Data Management;
						</li>
						<li>Provide a venue where young Latin American students and researchers can meet, discuss, learn, and seek feedback on their research topics, thus reinforcing research networks (of the future) in the area.
						</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

									<h4>Introduction to Mining Social Media Data</h4>
									The Social Web has become one of the largest human information and communication systems in history, impacting the lives of billions of people around the world. This social phenomenon is transforming the world in ways that were never imagined, shaping how we communicate and share information, how we do business or how we elect governments. In this tutorial we will provide an introduction to different types of social media data (Twitter, Facebook, Wikis, Forums) and to some of the models, tools and methods to represent, enrich and analyse them. We will discuss how, by mining this unprecedented resource, we can help targeting societal challenges, such as policy making, climate change, or disaster management, among others. Note that presentations will be combined with hands-on sessions, so don't forget to bring your laptops with you!
