                        <h4>Biopics</h4>
                        Dr. María Eugenia Monge is an Independent Researcher of CONICET, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina. In 2006, she obtained her Ph.D. in Inorganic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2007, she conducted a postdoctoral stance in the research group of Pier Luigi San Biagio at the Biophysical Institute of Palermo-CNR, Italy, to analyze gas-phase fingerprints obtained with electronic noses comprised of semiconductor-based chemical sensors using chemometric tools and GC-MS. Between 2008 and 2011 she held a postdoctoral position in the research group of Christian George at IRCELYON-CNRS, France, to study photoinduced transformations of atmospheric aerosol particles and the effect of light in heterogeneous reactions between trace gases and different substrates. In 2012, she joined the group of Facundo Fernández as a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA to work in the field of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics for biomarker discovery, and in the development of quantitative methods for biological and pharmaceutical sample analysis. In 2014, she was recruited by CONICET to set-up a new laboratory at CIBION, a recently founded research center of CONICET, where she leads the Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry (MS) Group (https://cibion.conicet.gov.ar/mass-spectrometry/?lan=en) and the MS facility. Her research group applies MS for biomarker discovery and early disease detection, with special emphasis on untargeted metabolomics-based diagnostics. The applications her group is currently working on include biomarker discovery studies for renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer detection in collaboration with Argentine biobanking systems and hospitals. Her group is also involved in collaborative studies applying metabolomics workflows to address health-related scientific questions in the fields of cancer metabolism, molecular neurobiology, and dengue disease, using in vitro and in vivo models. As well, the Monge lab has participated in a H2020-MSCA-RISE network to investigate marine chemical environments with ambient MS-based untargeted metabolomics strategies. Her group is also developing free and open source tools for preprocessing LC-MS data for quality control procedures in untargeted metabolomics workflows. Dr. Monge is co-author of > 40 peer-reviewed publications (https://cibion.conicet.gov.ar/dra-monge-publications/?lan=en). Since her return to Argentina, Dr. Monge has coordinated metabolomics courses in CIBION for South American students, and has participated in promoting awareness of metabolomics and its advantages throughout Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia with the hope of broadening and strengthening the South American metabolomics community. She was an invited speaker in the last two meetings of the Latin American Metabolic Profiling Society (LAMPS). Since 2019, she has been a member of the Metabolomics Society and the Metabolomics Quality Assurance and Quality Control Consortium (mQACC), where she participates on the Defining Best Practices working group; and she serves as a member of the Metabolomics Society Membership Committee. Dr. Monge also served as guest editor for the journal Metabolites; and she is an editorial board member of GigaByte.
