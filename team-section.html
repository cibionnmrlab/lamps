                        <h3>The challenges</h3>
        <p>Performing Metabolomics in Latin America, and research in general, comes with some additional challenges for researchers and lab managers:
        </p>
        <h4>Challenge 1) Instrument choice (robustness of instrument to less controlled conditions)</h4>
        <p>Latin America isn't producing research equipment thus all of them have to be imported. And although Latin America is a growing research market it is still very small when compared to the big nations of research, meaning that only a few companies have their own teams in Latin America, let aside in each country.
        </p>

        <h4>Challenge 2) Accommodating variability in physical and financial climates</h4>
        <p>
        Research is still underrated in almost all Latin American countries, as is their budgets dedicated to science and innovation. This systematic underfunding impacts negatively on the sciences policies, mainly resulting in a lack of stable priorities and long-term investment strategies. This is a major obstacle to building a robust research infrastructure in our region.
        </p>

        <h4>Challenge 3) Restricted material supply</h4>
        In the same vein, little has been done by weak or inexistent Ministries of Science to improve the importation process of research equipment. As a result, the purchase of research gears is more expensive and take more time that it should. Typically, both importation and nationalization processes will increase the price by at least 30% up to 200%, while a simple kit may take 3 to 6 months to purchase.
        <p>
        
        </p>
        <h4>Challenge 4) Open source software and data repositories</h4>
        <p>
        The access to resources behind paywall is a major obstacle for underfunded researchers. This includes research papers, dataset or any database or software that is under a commercial license. Interestingly, Latin America is not a leading actor in open science and open data movements. To the contrary the systematically underfunded Ministries of Sciences stays way behind their counterparts when it comes to negotiating national agreements or to draft new open policies that would ultimately benefit their researchers.
        </p>

        <h4>Challenge 5) Corporate recognition of the benefits of supporting resource-limited laboratories and institutions</h4>
        <p>
        The Latin American research market is not attractive enough for vendors and manufacturers to offer competitive support according to the different requirements, such as delayed payments schemes, corporate discounts and maintenance strategies that would effectively compensate for the lack of coherent national policies. 
        </p>

        <h4>Challenge 6) Transfer of technology and expertise</h4>
        <p>
        The high upfront cost of setting up a metabolomic profiling infrastructure led to the concentration of equipments and skilled researchers in a handful of international hubs. These hubs are attractive for new talented researchers allowing for sustainable formation programs, i.e., a balanced inbound and outbound flow of researchers whose contributions outweight the efforts required to train them. To the contrary, Latin American "hubs" must send their researchers abroad for training and then are struggling to match operative conditions in the lab. While this leads to a constant transfer of skills, which is positive, it also increases the pressure to match the experimental conditions, and leaves no possibility to build a national critical mass. Altogether this adds to the costs of running a facility in Latin America. 
        </p>
        <h3>The goals</h3>
        <p>
            The LAMPS seeks to find sustainable solutions to grow a robust and stable capacity for metabolomics in Latin America, that includes joint-training camp, continent-wide collaborative projects, sharing experiences and practices relevant to Latin America, unified participation in international networking activities, among other things.

                        <h4>The research</h4>
                        Dr. María Eugenia Monge is an Independent Researcher of CONICET, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina. In 2006, she obtained her Ph.D. in Inorganic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2007, she conducted a postdoctoral stance in the research group of Pier Luigi San Biagio at the Biophysical Institute of Palermo-CNR, Italy, to analyze gas-phase fingerprints obtained with electronic noses comprised of semiconductor-based chemical sensors using chemometric tools and GC-MS. Between 2008 and 2011 she held a postdoctoral position in the research group of Christian George at IRCELYON-CNRS, France, to study photoinduced transformations of atmospheric aerosol particles and the effect of light in heterogeneous reactions between trace gases and different substrates. In 2012, she joined the group of Facundo Fernández as a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA to work in the field of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics for biomarker discovery, and in the development of quantitative methods for biological and pharmaceutical sample analysis. In 2014, she was recruited by CONICET to set-up a new laboratory at CIBION, a recently founded research center of CONICET, where she leads the Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry (MS) <a href="https://cibion.conicet.gov.ar/mass-spectrometry/?lan=en">Group</a> and the MS facility. Her research group applies MS for biomarker discovery and early disease detection, with special emphasis on untargeted metabolomics-based diagnostics. The applications her group is currently working on include biomarker discovery studies for renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer detection in collaboration with Argentine biobanking systems and hospitals. Her group is also involved in collaborative studies applying metabolomics workflows to address health-related scientific questions in the fields of cancer metabolism, molecular neurobiology, and dengue disease, using in vitro and in vivo models. As well, the Monge lab has participated in a H2020-MSCA-RISE network to investigate marine chemical environments with ambient MS-based untargeted metabolomics strategies. Her group is also developing free and open source tools for preprocessing LC-MS data for quality control procedures in untargeted metabolomics workflows. Since her return to Argentina, Dr. Monge has coordinated metabolomics courses in CIBION for South American students, and has participated in promoting awareness of metabolomics and its advantages throughout Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia with the hope of broadening and strengthening the South American metabolomics community. She was an invited speaker in the last two meetings of the Latin American Metabolic Profiling Society (LAMPS). Since 2019, she has been a member of the Metabolomics Society and the Metabolomics Quality Assurance and Quality Control Consortium (mQACC), where she participates on the Defining Best Practices working group; and she serves as a member of the Metabolomics Society Membership Committee. Dr. Monge also served as guest editor for the journal Metabolites; and she is an editorial board member of GigaByte.

                        <h4>The research</h4>
                        Pablo Hoijemberg an Associate Researcher of CONICET, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina. He leads the Bioanalytical NMR Group since 2015 at the "Centro de Investigaciones en Bionanociencias (CIBION-CONICET)", Center for Bionanosciences Research, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received his PhD in Chemistry from the Universidad de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires, Argentina) in 2009, performing research in photochemistry. He remained in the field of photochemistry for about 4 years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Université de Haute Alsace in Mulhouse, France, and at Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA. Then, in August 2013 Pablo switched fields to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based Metabolomics, working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with Dr. István Pelczer, at the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. He conducted research on NMR metabolomics on biological samples, as well as chemometric analyses on complex mixtures. 
                        At CIBION Pablo is finishing the setup of the NMR laboratory, which will soon have a Bruker Avance NEO 500 MHz system installed, with a SmartProbe and Sample Case Cooled sampling system, to focus on metabolomics studies. The first projects involve studies on renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer, in collaboration with local hospitals and a biobank, for potential biomarker discovery and early disease diagnostics. In addition, the system will have the first HR-MAS probe in Argentina, aiming at metabolomics studies on biopsy tissues in the near future. Together with Dr. María Eugenia Monge, his metabolomics partner at CIBION (specialized in mass spectrometry), he coordinated and taught hands-on metabolomics courses at CIBION for students from the region. Pablo was an invited speaker in the Latin American Metabolic Profiling Symposium held in Rosario in 2016, and was going to be an invited speaker for the 2020 meeting, postponed due to the pandemic.
                        During these past years the Bioanalytical NMR Group developed bioinformatics methodologies based on JRES spectra to improve speed and accuracy in metabolite identification, by surpassing the intrinsic “limitations” of statistical correlation (STOCSY) in 1D spectral sets, namely peak overlap, peak misalignment, low intensity signals and biological correlation. COCOA-POD deals mainly with peak overlap by performing the statistical correlation analysis on the 2D JRES matrix and projecting from the nontilted JRES-STOCSY spectrum to obtain 1D traces that can be peak picked for database queries, free of overlap from non-correlated peaks at the same f2 values. Then, the CSMDB with ConQuer ABC presents the first searchable database for multiplets with scoring, allowing for f1 trace comparison for multiplet matching and ambiguity detection, incorporating also consecutive queries to assess biologically correlated metabolites through the integration with the metabolite identification.

                        Martin Arán, PhD
Director of NMR Facility at Fundación Instituto Leloir-IIBBA-CONICET (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Our laboratory works collaboratively with groups from scientific centers and industries in Argentina. We participate in projects and provide services in NMR of proteins (dynamics, structure) and metabolomics. (https://www.inis-biotech.com.ar/es/STAN2616)

Our lab uses NMR to understand the structural basis of protein activity and the chemical basis of cell metabolism. Our primary organism is Bizionia argentinensis, a psicrotolerant bacterium isolated from the sea surface in Antarctica. We are interested in the structural and functional characterization of proteins, the search for new low-temperature active enzymes and the discovery of natural bioactive products produced by Bizionia argentinensis. The magnitude of the true chemical potential of marine bacteria is still far from being established and NMR represents a valuable tool to determine the identity and structure of these compounds. We also are very interested in other marine bacteria, including pathogenic species. Dr. Arán got his start in NMR as a postdoc working with Dr. Daniel Cicero (FIL-IIBBA, Buenos Aires and University Tor Vergata, Rome) and specialized in metabolomics with Dr. Arthur Edison (Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics, Florida).

                        <h4>The research</h4>
                       Dr. Ian Castro-Gamboa is a professor and researcher at São Paulo State University (UNESP). In 2000 he obtained his Ph.D in natural products chemistry at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), researching chemosystematics and secondary metabolite vertical transference from grafted trees of economic importance. From 2000 to 2002 he conducted a postdoctoral research at NuBBE (Nuclei of Bioassays, Biosynthesis and Natural Products Ecophysiology) researching electrochemical active molecules from crude extract using HPLC-EQD and creating a database aiming antioxidant metabolites from plants from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest and Cerrado. In 2003 he joined the Institute of Chemistry faculty at IQ-UNESP, starting the qualitative analysis of a bank of extract from Brazilian plants using MS and NMR. He joined Art Edison’s research group at the University of Florida (UF) from 2009-2010, developing dereplications analysis of high complexity extracts using NMR. He has mentored 15 masters dissertations and 10 Ph.D thesis aiming metabolomics and the understanding the chemical composition from plants and microorganisms from Brazilian biodiversity. For the past decade, his research group has endeavor significant efforts to study a collection of microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of Senna spectabilis, aiming the isolation of molecular precursors from piperidine alkaloids. Through several joint projects, his team was able to study fungal biotransformation of selected molecules, enhanced chemical and biological diversity by co-culture, as well as inducing cryptic antimicrobial secondary metabolites. In addition, this fascinating journey allowed the development of novel dereplication strategies using MS and NMR in order to understand the complexity of fungal interactions in this intriguing biological niche. Additionally, Prof. Castro-Gamboa has published 75 manuscripts in diverse scientific journals as we as authored 2 book chapters and 4 patents. He has been selected as a speaker and plenary lecturer at The American Society og Pharmacognosy (ASP), Gesellschaft für Arzneipflanzen und Naturstoff-Forschung (GA), Brazilian Society of Chemistry (SBQ), Brazilian Conference on Natural Products (BCNP), amongst other scientific societies. He also has been invited as lecturer in short courses using NMR as a tool in the metabolomic scenario in Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia and Argentina. Since 2013 Prof. Castro-Gamboa coordinates the NMR platform at IQ-UNESP and from 2018-2022 is the head of the Department of Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry at IQ-UNESP. <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/9032973705204320">More information.</a>
