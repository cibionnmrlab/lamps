                        <h4>The research</h4>
                        Dr. María Eugenia Monge is an Independent Researcher of CONICET, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina. In 2006, she obtained her Ph.D. in Inorganic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2007, she conducted a postdoctoral stance in the research group of Pier Luigi San Biagio at the Biophysical Institute of Palermo-CNR, Italy, to analyze gas-phase fingerprints obtained with electronic noses comprised of semiconductor-based chemical sensors using chemometric tools and GC-MS. Between 2008 and 2011 she held a postdoctoral position in the research group of Christian George at IRCELYON-CNRS, France, to study photoinduced transformations of atmospheric aerosol particles and the effect of light in heterogeneous reactions between trace gases and different substrates. In 2012, she joined the group of Facundo Fernández as a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA to work in the field of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics for biomarker discovery, and in the development of quantitative methods for biological and pharmaceutical sample analysis. In 2014, she was recruited by CONICET to set-up a new laboratory at CIBION, a recently founded research center of CONICET, where she leads the Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry (MS) <a href="https://cibion.conicet.gov.ar/mass-spectrometry/?lan=en">Group</a> and the MS facility. Her research group applies MS for biomarker discovery and early disease detection, with special emphasis on untargeted metabolomics-based diagnostics. The applications her group is currently working on include biomarker discovery studies for renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer detection in collaboration with Argentine biobanking systems and hospitals. Her group is also involved in collaborative studies applying metabolomics workflows to address health-related scientific questions in the fields of cancer metabolism, molecular neurobiology, and dengue disease, using in vitro and in vivo models. As well, the Monge lab has participated in a H2020-MSCA-RISE network to investigate marine chemical environments with ambient MS-based untargeted metabolomics strategies. Her group is also developing free and open source tools for preprocessing LC-MS data for quality control procedures in untargeted metabolomics workflows. Dr. Monge is co-author of > 40 peer-reviewed <a href="https://cibion.conicet.gov.ar/dra-monge-publications/?lan=en">publications</a>. Since her return to Argentina, Dr. Monge has coordinated metabolomics courses in CIBION for South American students, and has participated in promoting awareness of metabolomics and its advantages throughout Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia with the hope of broadening and strengthening the South American metabolomics community. She was an invited speaker in the last two meetings of the Latin American Metabolic Profiling Society (LAMPS). Since 2019, she has been a member of the Metabolomics Society and the Metabolomics Quality Assurance and Quality Control Consortium (mQACC), where she participates on the Defining Best Practices working group; and she serves as a member of the Metabolomics Society Membership Committee. Dr. Monge also served as guest editor for the journal Metabolites; and she is an editorial board member of GigaByte.

                        <h4>The research</h4>
                        Our main research interest is to use NMR and cheminformatics to help unravel complex mixtures. Our tools are available at <a href="https://www.cheminfo.org">cheminfo.org</a> as demo. A repository for small molecules can be found at <a href="https://c6h6.org">c6h6.org</a>. All our developments are open source and can be found at <a href="http://github.com/cheminfo">github.com/cheminfo</a>. Have a look at <a href="https://nmrdb.org">nmrdb.org</a> for exercises! Aside from cheminformatics we also apply NMR to  <a href="https://www.cheminfo.org/flavor/metabolomics/index">metabolomics</a> and have fun playing with diffusion experiment.

                        <h4>The research</h4>
                        Martin Arán, PhD
Director of NMR Facility at Fundación Instituto Leloir-IIBBA-CONICET (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Our laboratory works collaboratively with groups from scientific centers and industries in Argentina. We participate in projects and provide services in NMR of proteins (dynamics, structure) and metabolomics. (https://www.inis-biotech.com.ar/es/STAN2616)

Our lab uses NMR to understand the structural basis of protein activity and the chemical basis of cell metabolism. Our primary organism is Bizionia argentinensis, a psicrotolerant bacterium isolated from the sea surface in Antarctica. We are interested in the structural and functional characterization of proteins, the search for new low-temperature active enzymes and the discovery of natural bioactive products produced by Bizionia argentinensis. The magnitude of the true chemical potential of marine bacteria is still far from being established and NMR represents a valuable tool to determine the identity and structure of these compounds. We also are very interested in other marine bacteria, including pathogenic species. Dr. Arán got his start in NMR as a postdoc working with Dr. Daniel Cicero (FIL-IIBBA, Buenos Aires and University Tor Vergata, Rome) and specialized in metabolomics with Dr. Arthur Edison (Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics, Florida).
