                            <p>Performing Metabolomics in Latin America, and research in general, comes with some additional challenges for researchers and lab managers:
                            </p>
                            <h4>CHALLENGE 1) INSTRUMENT CHOICE (ROBUSTNESS OF INSTRUMENTATION TO LESS CONTROLLED CONDITIONS)</h4>
                            <p>Latin America isn't producing research equipment thus instrumentation has to be imported. Although Latin America is a growing research market, it is still very small when compared to the big nations of research, meaning that only a few companies/vendors have their own teams in Latin America, but not in all countries.
